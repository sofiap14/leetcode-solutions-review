        return c

1. Initialize a counter variable c to 0 and an empty list l.
2. Loop through each row i in the matrix using a for loop:
3. Check if the sum of the row i is 0 or greater than 1.
4. If it is, skip to the next iteration of the loop using the continue keyword.
5. Otherwise, append the index of the 1 in row i to the list l using the index() method.
6. Loop through each column col in the transposed matrix using the zip() function and the asterisk (*) operator to unpack the columns:
7. Check if the index of column col is in the list l and the sum of column col is 1.
8. If both conditions are true, increment the counter variable c by 1.
9. Return the value of the counter variable c as the result of the function.
