You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if prices is None:
            return 0
        l, r = 0, 1
        max_profit = 0
        while r < len(prices):
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            else:
                l = r
            r += 1
        return max_profit
