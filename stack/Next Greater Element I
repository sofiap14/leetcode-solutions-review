class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = {}
        stack = [] 
        for num in nums2:
            while stack and num > stack[-1]:
                res[stack.pop()] = num
            stack.append(num)
        while stack:
            res[stack.pop()] = -1
        return [res.get(num, -1) for num in nums1]
        
        
1. We use a dictionary res to store the mapping from each element in nums2 to its next greater element
2. We iterate through nums2 and use a stack to keep track of elements that have not found their next greater element yet
   For each element num:
      a. We pop all elements from the stack that are smaller than num and set their next greater element to num
      b. We add num to the stack
3. After iterating through nums2, we set the next greater element of all remaining elements in the stack to -1
4. Finally, we create a list of next greater elements for each element in nums1 by looking up its mapping in res
   If an element is not in res, it means it doesn't have a next greater element, so we set it to -1.
